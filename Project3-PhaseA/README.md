# ENPM-661 Project 2



#NOTE : The path to the goal from start to end can be seen at the very end of the video and the animation is very quick(keep an eye out for it).

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download all the files into a folder.

The functions.py file contains all the function definitions.

2. Open terminal and run the python file from the folder as:

```
$ python3 astar_rishikesh_nishant.py
```

or run the file python3 astar_rishikesh_nishant.py from any other IDE and follow the instructions on the terminal.

The generated video will be saved in the same folder containing all the above files.

You will need the fllowing libraries
cv2
numpy
queue
math

If you select values which are far from each other it will take time to get the video animation ready.
